# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 24th, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Set up this repository, and built the empty template of a blog to document 2023 progress and beyond. Tried using **11ty** for static site generation, but decided to move to NextJS to complement the work I'm doing at the day job.

**Thoughts** 100 days is a long prospect, but breaking it down into small chunks/projects will be key to getting through it.

### Day 2: January 25th, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Added Tailwind, learning about the different utility classes. Also discovered the [typography plugin](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/typography-plugin) for adding styling to the Markdown-generated HTML content.

**Thoughts** Reading about other people who had done the challenge, the consistent time focus is distinctly more important than the outcome. Managed a full cycle of Pomodoro (4x25mins) on non-work coding this evening.

### Day 3: January 26th, 2023

**Today's Progress**: More development on Contentlayer, although today was mostly used to understand how to learn it converts the data to JSON so it can be used elsewhere. Need more examples and time on this, I guess it's only in beta.

**Thoughts** Excited to have this project up and running so that I can use it to document the rest of the progress!
