# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 24th, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Set up this repository, and built the empty template of a blog to document 2023 progress and beyond. Tried using **11ty** for static site generation, but decided to move to NextJS to complement the work I'm doing at the day job.

**Thoughts** 100 days is a long prospect, but breaking it down into small chunks/projects will be key to getting through it.
